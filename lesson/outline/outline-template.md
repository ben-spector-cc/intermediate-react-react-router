## Exercise # 1: _What is routing?_

### Which course outcomes will be covered by this exercise?

1. Learners will be able to understand the purpose of routing, identify features that would require an app to implement routes, and name React Router as a popular solution for adding routing to React applications.

### Narrative Summary

P1: In this lesson, you will learn about routing–the process by which a web application determines what content to show a user based on the URL that user is visiting–as well as React Router–a popular tool for adding routing to React applications. 

P2: Routing is powerful because it allows you to organize an application's views. By allowing you to display only what the user has specifically requested to see, routing enables rich, engaging, and clear user experiences. 

P3: Walk the learner through the URL of the page displaying this course to drive the point home. eg. "Codeacdemy has lots of courses, but you're currently looking at this one. How did we decide which course to show you? Based on the URL you navigated to, we've displaying this specific course and not any others". The content that Codecademy displays to a user is determined by the URL that user visits.

## Exercise # 1.5: Single vs. Multi-Page Architecture

### Which course outcomes will be covered by this exercise?

1. Learners will be able to understand the difference between single page architecture and mult-page architecture

### Narrative Summary

P1: Walk through multipage architecture: GET to different paths would request different HTML from the server, and that HTML would be displayed in the browser. Whenever a page would load, the existing HTML would be wiped out and replaced, causing a distracting flash of the screen and a clunky user experience. 

P2: Single page architecture, on the other hand, leverages the power of Javascript to dynamically manipulate the DOM. In a SPA, when the user navigates to a new page, Javascript produces new markdown and renders it in the browser. Because this set-up does not require the server to produce new HTML, it eliminates that annoying flash that occurs whenever a page reloads.     

P2: React Router is a collection of componets that makes it easy to implement routing in single page React applications. React Router responds to URL changes by determining which components to display in the browser and updating the DOM accordingly.
